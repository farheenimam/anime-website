        <h1>Death Note</h1> <br>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">The core plot device of the story is the "Death Note" itself, a black notebook with instructions (known as "Rules of the Death Note") written on the inside. When used correctly, it allows anyone to commit a murder,
             knowing only the victim's name and face.</p>
             <br>
       <p style="font-size: 17px;">Death Note is an incredibly popular anime series that has captivated viewers for years.
        The manga was written by Tsugumi Ohba, illustrated by Takeshi Obata in 2003, and adapted into an anime series in 2006. It’s a story of a high school
         student who discovers a supernatural notebook that grants him the power to kill anyone whose name he writes in it.
         The story follows Light Yagami, a brilliant but bored high school student, as he uses the Death Note to create his own justice system and become the god of a new world order.
          The show is filled with intense psychological battles between Light and his nemesis, L, as they try to outwit each other. The animation is beautiful, and the soundtrack is also hauntingly beautiful.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Artist Takeshi Obata originally thought of the books as "Something you would automatically think was a Death Note". Deciding that this design would be cumbersome, he instead opted for a more accessible college 
            notebook. Death Notes were originally conceived as changing based on time and location, resembling scrolls in ancient Japan, or the Old Testament in medieval Europe. However, this idea was never used</p>
        <br>
            <h2>Theme</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">Writer Tsugumi Ohba had no particular themes in mind for Death Note. When pushed, he suggested: "Humans will all eventually die, so let's give it our all while we're alive".[15] In a 2012 paper, author Jolyon Baraka Thomas characterised Death Note as a psychological thriller released in the wake of the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, saying that it examines the human tendency to express itself through "horrific" cults.
                Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Mello joins the mafia whilst Near joins forces with the US government. Mello kidnaps Director Takimura, who Light then kills, so Mello, kidnaps Light's sister and exchanges her for the Death Note, using it to kill almost all of Near's team. A Shinigami named Sidoh goes to Earth to reclaim his notebook and ends up meeting and helping Mello. Light uses the notebook to find Mello's hideout, but Soichiro is killed in the mission. Mello and Near exchange information and Mello kidnaps Mogi and gives him to Near. Kira's supporters attack Near's group, but they escape. Aizawa becomes 
                suspicious of Light and meets with Near. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Near has Mikami followed whilst Aizawa's suspicions are confirmed. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.

However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow parent.

                        To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he creates the alias of Loid Forger, adopts a young orphan girl named Anya, and marries a woman named Yor Briar. However, unbeknownst to him Anya can read minds and Yor is in fact a professional assassin. Neither Loid nor Yor are aware of each other's true identities, or that Anya knows their true professions. The family later takes in a dog with precognitive abilities whom they name Bond. Despite these unknown factors and Twilight's occasional lapses of common sense due to years of being a spy, he must learn to play the role of the perfect father and husband in order to carry out his mission.</p>

            <h1>Jujutu Kaisen</h1> <br>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yōkai.

                Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will always connect and grow in strength.</p>
                <br>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">In 2020, the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba franchise generated an estimated annual sales revenue of ¥1 trillion ($8.75 billion).In January 2021, it was reported that Japanese sales of print.
                 books and magazines fell 1% in 2020 compared to the previous year, being the smallest per-year decline since 2006.</p>

            <h1>Demon slayer</h1> <br> 
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">The story takes place in the Taishō era Japan, where a secret organization, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, has waged a longtime war against demons for centuries. These demons are former humans who possess
                 supernatural abilities such as super strength, rapid regeneration, and unique powers referred to as "Blood Demon Art". Demons can only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted from a rare alloy
                  called Nichirin, injected with a poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to direct sunlight. <br>
                In contrast, the Demon Slayers are entirely human but employ specialized elemental breathing techniques known as "Breathing Styles". These techniques grant them superhuman strength and increased resilience that
                 enable them to fight demons effectively. The most formidable Demon Slayers hold the "Hashira" title and gain this rank through killing a member of the Twelve Kizuki, a organization comprising the twelve strongest
                  demons of their species, or killing fifty demons through multiple advancements in their rank.

                <p style="font-size: 17px;">Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. After his father's death, he became his family's breadwinner and travels to the nearby village to sell charcoal. One day, Tanjiro came home and discovers his family was slaughtered by a demon. His sister Nezuko is the sole survivor of the incident. She has been transformed into a demon, but still surprisingly shows signs of human emotion and thought. Following an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is recruited and send to Giyu's retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also become a Demon Slayer. He begins his quest to help Nezuko turn into a human again.
                    Two years later, Tanjiro learns the "Water Breathing" style after a strenuous training and takes part in a formidable exam. He is one of the few survivors to approve, officially making him a member of the Corps. Nezuko has been hypnotized to not harm humans and occasionally helps Tanjiro, who starts his work of hunting down and slaying demons. One of their assignments bring them to Asakusa where they encounter Muzan Kibutsuji, the evil progenitor of all demons and the responsible for the murder of their family. Tanjiro and Nezuko also meet Tamayo and Yushiro, two demons who are free from Muzan's control. They ally to develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply Tamayo with blood samples from the Twelve Kizuki – Kokushibo, Doma, Akaza, Hantengu, Gyokko, Gyutaro, Enmu, Rokuro, Wakuraba, Mukago, Rui, and Kamanue –, the twelve most powerful demons under Muzan's command.</p>
